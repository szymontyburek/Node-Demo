# Node-Hello-v2

What I learned from this project about Node:

Pros
- The event-driven, non-blocking nature.
- The convenience of using the same language for client and server sides.
- The scalability potential. Ability to handle a large # of concurrent connections.

Cons
- Single-threaded. Not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks, as bottlenecking can occur.
- Limited standard library.
- Error handling/Debugging. Harder process because JavaScript is an interpretive language.
